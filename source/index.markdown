Welcome to the StrathHack Website!
================================
What is StrathHack?
------------
StrathHack is GeekSoc's first MLH Hackathon. It is hopefully going to be the big finale to their UK Fall season.  
The purpose of this Hackathon is to challenge students from around the UK in industry.

What to expect?
-----
If you get a ticket and turn up to the hack you will be greeted by numerous industry sponsors who will pose to you (in teams of around 5) a series of challenges. Each Team then chooses a challenge to attempt
